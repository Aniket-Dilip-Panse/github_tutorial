 what is git ?
->VCS is a tool that help to track changes in code.
->free and open source 
->fast and scalable
->track the record and version of our project.
->collaborate between different developer and multiple features.
->git is a software that can be download on system.

what is github ?
->github is a website that allows developer to store and manage their code
using git.
->It is website to deploy project in form of repository.

what is commit ?
->Take a screenshot and track the changes.

step 1) create repository manually from github website.
eg:- github_tutorial add:- description and check on readme file.
#========after creating repository multiple option are available============
like code,issues,pull request,action,project,etc.

step 2)setting up Git
-> download Git and install into your pc
->type the command 'git --version' after completing all set up.

step 3)===== imporant step ===== Configuring Git
->git config --global user.name "My Name"
->git config --global user.email "aniketpanse12@gmail.com"
->git config list.

 symbol(~) == root directory of our system.
 symbol(M) == The file is modified and need to add first then commit.
 symbol(A) == The file is added to stage and ready to commit.
 symbol(U) == untracked file i.e newly created file.that is not known by git

 ==========================================================================
| types of status in git. 4 types.
|
| 1)untracked :- new file that git doesn't track yet
|
| 2)modified :- changes in file.
|
| 3)staged :- file is ready to commit
|
| 4)unmodified :- after commiting the status is unchanged.
|
 ==========================================================================

note:- untracked file and modified file can directly moved to staging area. 

note:- we can save the modification of repository by using git. But everytime
       we have to use the command in git.

step 4)Open VScode
->create empty folder at any location and open that same folder using VScode.
->WE CAN ACCESS GIT FROM IT TYPE git --version in terminal of that folder path
->================== CLONE AND STATUS COMMAND======================
======================== IMPORTANT =======================
1)CLONE :- cloning a github repository on local machine.
           git clone <some-link>
2)STATUS:- displays the state of the code
           git status
eg:- copy the link of github_tutorial repository.

     paste the git clone https://github.com/Aniket-Dilip-Panse/github_tutorial.git command 
     into the vscode terminal of that folder path.
     
     change the directory to github_tutorial using 'cd github_tutorial'
      
     git add <file_name> will add file to staging area of local system.
     git commit -m "message" will commit the message to local system.
 
     ======== MOST MOST MOST IMPORTANT MOST MOST MOST================
     using 'git add <file_name>' and 'git commit -m "message"' we are
     changing in local repository not on github repository.  
    ==================================================================

    ====TO SHOW CHANGES MADE ON LOCAL REPOSITORY INTO GITHUB REPOSITORY====
   | USE " git push origin main "
   |
   |here origin is the name of repository and 
   |main is the name of branch
   =======================================================================

eg:-2) The above example is how to clone github repository and perform action on it.

Now we are going to learn how to create repository first into our local system and the push on github

step 1):- create empty folder at any location and open that same folder using VScode.

step 2):- open terminal and use git bash
and check .git folder is created or not using ls -a if not then create using 'git init'.

step 3):- create multiple file inside empty folder. like:- index.html,style.css,script.js

step 4):- git add . and git commit -m "initial commit" but this command will not push
          on github.

step 5):- create empty repository on github
without readme.md

step 6):- git remote add origin <some-link>

step 7):- To check the link git remote -v

step 8):- To check branch git branch

step 9):- To change branch name git branch -M   <new name>  * mostly use main *

step 10):- git push -u origin main

GIT Branch:- There is atleast one branch in git. i.e main branch.

             It is a special branch in git.
             It is used to keep track of changes in local repository.

             creating branch always developer to develop multiple features and then merge the branch.

             To create new branch. 
             eg:- git branch <branch_name>

             To create new branch after specific commit.
             eg:- git branch <branch_name> <commit_id>

             To navigate from one branch to another. ek branch se durse branch pe navigate karne ke liye
             -->git checkout <branch_name>
             -->git switch <branch_name>

             To change branch name.
             -->git branch -M <old_name> <new_name>

             To delete branch.
             -->git branch -d <branch_name>

             To publish local branch on github
             -->git push -u origin <local-branch_name>

GIT MERGE:- merge two or more branch into one.
            ==== method 1 using git command ====
           eg:- git merge <branch_name>

           ==== method 2 using githhub website generating pull request====
           eg:- step 1:- click on compare and pull request
                step 2:- write any message on add new feature and click on create pull request
                step3:-github check wether we can automatically merge or not.
                       conflict may occur in that case we have to resolve it.
                step4:-click on merge button.

        ===== IMPORTANT =====
        changes made using method 2 of merge request will change on github but not on vscode local repository.for that we need to pull command

        GIT PULL COMMAND:- all content from github will be pulled into local repository.
        eg:- git pull origin main

GIT DIFF:- diff between two or more branch.
           eg:- git diff <branch_name> <main branch>

========== HOW TO HANDLE MERGE CONFLICT IN GIT ==========

step 1:- create new changes in main 
step 2:- add,commit and push that changes to main branch
step 3:- create new branch with any name.
step 4:- add,commit and push that changes to new branch 
======== MOST IMPORTANT==== the changes made in main branch and changes made in new branch must be on same line.
then only the merge conflict occur.
