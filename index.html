    <h1>GITHUB TUTORIAL</h1>
    <p> what is git ?
        ->VCS is a tool that help to track changes in code.
        ->free and open source 
        ->fast and scalable
        ->track the record and version of our project.
        ->collaborate between different developer and multiple features.
        ->git is a software that can be download on system.
        
        what is github ?
        ->github is a website that allows developer to store and manage their code
        using git.
        ->It is website to deploy project in form of repository.
        
        what is commit ?
        ->Take a screenshot and track the changes.
        
        step 1) create repository manually from github website.
        eg:- github_tutorial add:- description and check on readme file.
        #========after creating repository multiple option are available============
        like code,issues,pull request,action,project,etc.
        
        step 2)setting up Git
        -> download Git and install into your pc
        ->type the command 'git --version' after completing all set up.
        
        step 3)===== imporant step ===== Configuring Git
        ->git config --global user.name "My Name"
        ->git config --global user.email "aniketpanse12@gmail.com"
        ->git config list.
        
         symbol(~) == root directory of our system.
         symbol(M) == The file is modified and need to add first then commit.
         symbol(A) == The file is added to stage and ready to commit.
         symbol(U) == untracked file i.e newly created file.that is not known by git
        
         ==========================================================================
        | types of status in git. 4 types.
        |
        | 1)untracked :- new file that git doesn't track yet
        |
        | 2)modified :- changes in file.
        |
        | 3)staged :- file is ready to commit
        |
        | 4)unmodified :- after commiting the status is unchanged.
        |
         ==========================================================================
        
        note:- untracked file and modified file can directly moved to staging area. 
        
        note:- we can save the modification of repository by using git. But everytime
               we have to use the command in git.
        
        step 4)Open VScode
        ->create empty folder at any location and open that same folder using VScode.
        ->WE CAN ACCESS GIT FROM IT TYPE git --version in terminal of that folder path
        ->================== CLONE AND STATUS COMMAND======================
        ======================== IMPORTANT =======================
        1)CLONE :- cloning a github repository on local machine.
                   git clone <some-link>
        2)STATUS:- displays the state of the code
                   git status
        eg:- copy the link of github_tutorial repository.
        
             paste the git clone https://github.com/Aniket-Dilip-Panse/github_tutorial.git command 
             into the vscode terminal of that folder path.
             
             change the directory to github_tutorial using 'cd github_tutorial'
              
             git add <file_name> will add file to staging area of local system.
             git commit -m "message" will commit the message to local system.
         
             ======== MOST MOST MOST IMPORTANT MOST MOST MOST================
             using 'git add <file_name>' and 'git commit -m "message"' we are
             changing in local repository not on github repository.  
            ==================================================================
        
            ====TO SHOW CHANGES MADE ON LOCAL REPOSITORY INTO GITHUB REPOSITORY====
           | USE " git push origin main "
           |
           |here origin is the name of repository and 
           |main is the name of branch
           =======================================================================
        
        eg:-2) The above example is how to clone github repository and perform action on it.
        
        Now we are going to learn how to create repository first into our local system and the push on github
        
        step 1):- create empty folder at any location and open that same folder using VScode.
        
        step 2):- open terminal and use git bash
        and check .git folder is created or not using ls -a if not then create using 'git init'.
        
        step 3):- create multiple file inside empty folder. like:- index.html,style.css,script.js
        
        step 4):- git add . and git commit -m "initial commit" but this command will not push
                  on github.
        
        step 5):- create empty repository on github
        without readme.md
        
        step 6):- git remote add origin <some-link>
        
        step 7):- To check the link git remote -v
        
        step 8):- To check branch git branch
        
        step 9):- To change branch name git branch -M   <new name>  * mostly use main *</p>
